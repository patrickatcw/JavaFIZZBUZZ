/*
Directions
Write a “FizzBuzz” program: for the numbers from 1 to 20, if a number is divisible by 3, print out “Fizz”.
If a number is divisible by 5, print out “Buzz”. If a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print out “Fizz Buzz.”
Otherwise, just print out the number. Hint: look up the modulo operator.
Here’s what he first three lines of your program output should look like:

	1
	2
	Fizz

public class FizzBuzz {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }

}
